3. Add your models/textures/assets (See [Pack Generator Wiki > Adding Assets])
4. Submit a [Pull Request]  

> Or join our [discord server] and ask in `#🎨|resource-packs `

Make sure to following all of the [Contributing Guidelines](#contributing-guidelines)

You can also help by:
- Reporting bugs or texture issues  
- Suggesting new model ideas  
- Providing visual references for future features  

All contributors will be **credited directly in the README** and inside the in-game pack metadata.

## Contributing Guidelines

1. When adding any new textures/models only add your own assets unless explicit permission has been granted.
   - If the latter is the case, provide proof of the permission within your Pull Request
2. Do not add any textures/models that were made through the use of generative A.I.
3. Always include `"author"` tags in any new models or item/block definitions. 
   - If you are modifying a pre-existing asset by a different author, add your name after there own, separated by commas.
